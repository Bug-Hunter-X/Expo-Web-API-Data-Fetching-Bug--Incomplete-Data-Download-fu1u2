# Expo Web API Data Fetching Bug: Incomplete Data Download

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Web API when fetching large amounts of data.  The issue is that the response data isn't fully downloaded before processing, causing unexpected application behavior.

## Bug Description
When fetching data from a remote source using `fetch` or similar methods, if the response is substantial, the application might attempt to access and parse the data before the download is complete. This can result in errors, incomplete data display, or even crashes.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that the entire response is downloaded before processing.  We can achieve this using the `response.blob()` method to obtain the entire response body as a Blob, and then using a FileReader to read the Blob's content. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the errors or unexpected behavior when fetching data.

## How to Fix
1. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for the implemented solution.
2. Implement similar methods in your project to avoid this bug.
